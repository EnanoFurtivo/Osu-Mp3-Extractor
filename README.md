# Osu-Mp3-Extractor

Hi Everyone i was wondering if i could listen to some beats i had inside osu! in my phone, so i started to copy the files straight into it manually. Of course i got away with the awful Unicode Titles ex: (). and artists ex: (). So i made this program in C# wich allows you to select from your entire map collection. The maps you want will be correctly copied and exported with the original title and artist that are written in ASCII.
