Hello to anyone reading this, i have hope you are having a nice day!! 
As a TL:DR, this app just copies osu! mp3's songs into a folder. 

A more detailed description would be:
[list][*]This app is meant to allow you to listen some music from your osu!, within a standard media player app ex. VLC, Groove, and even on your phone!! Via copying the audio files within a map into a folder of your choice.[/list]

Its key features are:
[list][*]You can select to export a collection made in osu!, or your complete library if you wish to!
[*]It can fix mp3 tags, and also it can export your songs with the same backgroung you see in osu!, so you dont have to see something like this in your media player:[/list]

Some features no one really cares about are:
- It is portable (As long as you have .NET installed, wich you probably have anyways).
- It is lightweight.
- And there really isnt much more to it really.

The way it works is very simple, here is the explanation:
- You will be promted with this screen on first start up:

All you have to do is select your folder where osu! is installed on, and the folder where your exported songs will be copied. That's it, it really is that simple.

- Now you could fiddle arround with the extra configurations, although i recommend to just leave them the way they are by default. Please use some common sense for this settings if your gonna change them, it should'nt be too hard to figure out what they do!!


Some notes about the internal management of the program:
- [Exporting complete library] Since you could add a map with 100 difficulties in a single collection, when extracting the full library, only the last difficulty will be chosen for the extract, unfortunately there is no way arround this. What you should do instead is make for example a music collection in osu, and save only the difficulties you want to extract per mapset!!
- [Exporting a collection] It was litteraly explained in the las quote, when extracting a colletion the program will export all difficulties per mapset in that collection, not only the last!! This is done this way because there could be mapsets with difficulties that have different audio files. Be careful with saving entire mapsets on your collection, you could end up with repeated audio files!!

Some final developer words:
- Im currently studying for a computer sistems degree, so expect no more than that out of this program, although i think i've done a pretty good job at rewriting this app from scratch.
- Im completely open for suggestions, although it might take a while for me to try to implement them or even check them, depending on if i have uni work to do or not.
- I do take this project as a learning experience, since i have'nt really had any object oriented programing yet. So any objective critics or advice is hugely apreciated (code wise).
